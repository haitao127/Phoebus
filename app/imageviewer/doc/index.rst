Image Viewer
============

Overview
--------

As the name suggests, the Image Viewer renders an image file at full resolution
in a separate tab in the main window.

There is no menu entry for the application. It is launched automatically for instance
when user double clicks on an image file in the File Browser, or when user clicks on
an image in the log entry attachment viewer.

Supported file types are png, jpg (jpeg) and gif. The application also supports Scalable Vector Graphics
files, but user should keep in mind that SVG tools may generate incompatible files.

If user has configured an external application for a particular image file extension, this is
NOT overridden by the Image Viewer application.
